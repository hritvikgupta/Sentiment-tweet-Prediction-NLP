# Sentiment-tweet-Prediction-NLP

Sentiment tweet analysis is a machine learning project which uses the Natural language Processing to analyze and predict on tweet
The objective of this Project is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.
Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.
